**Social Transfer Knot (STK)** is a decentralized mini-social network built entirely on Telegram. Users can post messages, broadcast them automatically to all other users, and manage their personal nickname — all without storing messages on Telegram servers.

---

## ✨ Features

- Users must **log in with a one-time token** before posting.  
- Users can set a **unique, alphanumeric nickname** (3–20 characters, case-insensitive).  
- Messages posted with `/post <text>` are **automatically broadcast** to all registered users.  
- Admin commands for **token generation** and **user deletion**.  
- Persistent local storage using SQLite.
